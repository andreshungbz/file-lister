# File Lister

A simple program in C++ that uses the `filesystem` standard library to take a directory filepath and list all regular files within that directory recursively. The output is not sorted. An argument can be provided or if not, a path is prompted from the user. This program checks for valid pathnames. Binaries are available in the Releases page.

## Usage

### Providing an Argument

```
./file_lister <directory>
```

### Standalone

```
./file_lister
```
